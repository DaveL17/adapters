### TODO 
- Wiki docs.
- Add menu item to refresh Adapter devices.  (Is this needed 
  since the plugin subscribes to changes?)
- Add UI icon to device types that don't have one.
- Split the device/variable and state selectors.
- A button within the device configuration dialog to show the 
  results of the conversion so the user can test/tweak/test 
  before saving the settings.
- Some adapters can likely be removed since there's very little 
  likelihood that they will ever be used (Kelvin? Rankine?)
